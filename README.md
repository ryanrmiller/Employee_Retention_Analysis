Hey there!

If you're not coming from my website, check this project out over there first. It has a breif description (and some cool project art if I do say so myself.) Keep an eye out for "2. Employee Retention Analysis: EDA, Visualization, and Predictive Modeling."

Otherwise, the good stuff starts in my [lrm_part_1.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/ryanrmiller/Employee_Retention_Analysis/blob/main/lrm_part_1.ipynb) in this repository.
